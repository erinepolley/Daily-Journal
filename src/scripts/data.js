    title: "Week Three Beginning",
    contents: "This has been the hardest week of NSS so far. We have gone beyond the prework, and therefore beyond my comfort zone. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't in tears a few days ago. I was feeling overwhelmed and behind. I remembered the words of John Wark, and became so grateful that they spend a few hours the first day giving us a pep talk. It made me feel better about the future, and was a good reminder to trust the process. However, it didn't make me feel less uncomfortable with the situation.",

    title: "Week Three Lab Day",
    contents: "What a difference a lab day can make! Every single person I've talked to said they've felt the same way as me--overwhelmed and behind. It's such a nice surprise to discover we're all in the exact same boat. This lab day was perfect timting. My spirits brightened, and I worked hard to complete all the exercises and get caught up. What a difference ONE DAY makes, indeed!",

    title: "Fri-YAY",
    contents: "It's Friday! I have survived another week of NSS. Where on earth did the time go?? Today, I want to talk about my amazing cohort. The camaraderie is awesome. I love everyone in this cohort, and every single person adds value to our collective experience. Already, we have inside jokes (tacos and castles), and even our own memes. It doesn't matter who I eat lunch with. I laugh with these people, eat with these people, walk with these people, and study with these people. In other words, I share with these people. We share thoughts, laughs, and this crazy experience that is NSS. I can only hope that wherever I land in my job, the team has a culture a sliver as good as NSS Cohort 36.",
